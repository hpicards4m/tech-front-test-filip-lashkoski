## What need to be done
​
We want display a list of "POI"s (Point of Interests) and display them on a map using the MapBox library.
​
* Add the MapBox library into the project
* Develop the application by following the design specification (You'll find the application mockup and the design specification for the "resource item" component in `docs` folder)
* You can add everything you need or anything you think that can improve the project
* Use PrimeReact components to develop your proper components (PrimeReact is already added into the application)
​
## Specification
​
* Use the `pois` file in `data` folder to display the list of POIs with the Resource Item component
* Add `pois` points into the MapBox map
* Add the possibility to select a store in the list and zoom the map to the selected store
* (OPTIONAL) add a MapBox popup when you click on a store with infomrations (name, address, country, ...)
